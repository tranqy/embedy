# Build System Architecture

This document defines the architecture and requirements for Embedy's progressive loading system, bundle management, and fallback strategies. The system prioritizes performance on all devices while maintaining feature richness for capable environments.

## Architecture Principles

### Progressive Enhancement
The build system follows a progressive enhancement philosophy where core functionality loads first, followed by enhanced features based on device capabilities and network conditions.

### Performance Budget
- **Core Framework**: Maximum 18KB gzipped (includes essential polyfills)
- **Individual Components**: 3-8KB gzipped each
- **Complete Suite**: Maximum 45KB gzipped with all features
- **Time to Interactive**: Under 3 seconds on 3G networks

### Adaptive Loading
The system automatically detects and adapts to:
- Network quality (2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi)
- Device memory constraints
- Browser capabilities
- CPU performance characteristics
- Screen size and input methods

## Progressive Feature Loading

### Device Capability Detection

#### Requirements
The system must detect and categorize device capabilities to make intelligent loading decisions:

**Network Detection**:
- Use Network Information API when available
- Fall back to connection speed measurement
- Categorize into: 2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi
- Update categorization as conditions change

**Memory Detection**:
- Use Device Memory API when available
- Provide reasonable defaults for unknown devices
- Consider memory pressure events
- Adjust feature loading based on available memory

**Browser Capability Detection**:
- Check for modern JavaScript features
- Detect Web Component support
- Verify CSS feature availability
- Test for performance APIs

**Input Method Detection**:
- Identify touch vs mouse input
- Detect stylus or pen input
- Recognize keyboard-only navigation
- Support multi-modal input switching

### Feature Loading Strategy

#### Core Features (Always Loaded)
Essential functionality that every user receives:
- Basic form components
- Essential validation
- Core theming engine
- Accessibility fundamentals
- Error handling

#### Progressive Features
Additional capabilities loaded based on device profile:

**Advanced Validation** (Requires: Modern browser, 3G+, 2GB+ RAM):
- Complex validation rules
- Async validation
- Cross-field dependencies
- Custom validation functions

**Mobile Optimizations** (Requires: Touch device):
- Touch-friendly controls
- Gesture support
- Momentum scrolling
- Haptic feedback integration

**Virtual Scrolling** (Requires: Intersection Observer, 4GB+ RAM):
- Large dataset handling
- Infinite scroll support
- Viewport-based rendering
- Memory-efficient lists

**Rich Formatting** (Requires: 4G/WiFi):
- Rich text editors
- Advanced date pickers
- Color pickers
- File upload previews

### Loading Orchestration

The loading system should:
1. Assess device capabilities on initialization
2. Create an optimal feature profile
3. Load features in parallel where possible
4. Handle loading failures gracefully
5. Cache loaded features for subsequent use
6. Monitor performance impact during loading

### Implementation Considerations
See `docs/code-examples.md#progressive-feature-loading-device-capabilities-detection` for reference implementation patterns.

## Bundle Management

### Chunk Strategy

#### Vendor Chunks
Third-party dependencies grouped by update frequency:
- **Framework chunks**: Core libraries (Lit, React)
- **Utility chunks**: Validation, utilities
- **Integration chunks**: Communication libraries
- **Polyfill chunks**: Compatibility layers

#### Feature Chunks
Functionality grouped by usage patterns:
- **Component chunks**: Individual UI components
- **Feature chunks**: Cross-component capabilities
- **Theme chunks**: Styling and branding
- **Locale chunks**: Internationalization resources

#### Chunk Naming Strategy
Predictable naming enables:
- Effective browser caching
- CDN optimization
- Debug-friendly identification
- Version management

### Bundle Optimization

#### Size Optimization
- Tree-shaking for unused code removal
- Minification with source map support
- Compression with Brotli/Gzip
- Asset optimization (images, fonts)
- Code splitting at logical boundaries

#### Load Optimization
- Preload critical resources
- Prefetch likely next resources
- DNS prefetch for external resources
- Resource hints for optimal loading
- Service Worker integration for caching

#### Cache Strategy
Different caching policies by resource type:
- **Immutable**: Vendor libraries (1 year)
- **Long-term**: Core framework (1 month)
- **Medium-term**: Features (1 week)
- **Short-term**: Themes (1 day)
- **No-cache**: User-specific data

### Implementation Considerations
See `docs/code-examples.md#bundle-splitting-configuration` for reference implementation patterns.

## Polyfill Management

### Feature Detection

#### Required Features
Core features that need polyfills in older browsers:
- Custom Elements v1
- Shadow DOM v1
- ES6+ syntax features
- Fetch API
- Promise support
- Web Crypto API
- Intersection Observer
- Resize Observer
- CSS Custom Properties
- CSS Containment

#### Detection Strategy
1. Test for native support first
2. Load only missing polyfills
3. Use feature detection, not browser detection
4. Cache detection results
5. Re-test after browser updates

### Loading Strategies

#### Eager Loading
For critical polyfills needed immediately:
- Applied to core functionality polyfills
- Blocks application initialization
- Timeout protection to prevent hanging
- Parallel loading where possible

#### Lazy Loading
For enhancement polyfills:
- Loaded during idle time
- Uses requestIdleCallback when available
- Non-blocking to main functionality
- Progressive enhancement approach

#### On-Demand Loading
For feature-specific polyfills:
- Loaded only when feature is used
- Proxy pattern for transparent loading
- Minimal performance impact
- Memory efficient

### Polyfill Sources

#### Primary Sources
1. Modern CDN with global coverage
2. Fallback CDN for redundancy
3. Local bundled copies as last resort
4. Service Worker cached versions

#### Version Management
- Lock polyfill versions for stability
- Test updates in staging first
- Monitor for security updates
- Gradual rollout of updates

### Implementation Considerations
See `docs/code-examples.md#polyfill-loader-with-feature-detection` for reference implementation patterns.

## Fallback Strategies

### Multi-Tier Fallback System

#### Loading Fallbacks
Progressive fallback chain for failed loads:

1. **Primary Import**: Standard module import
2. **Alternative CDN**: Backup content delivery
3. **Local Bundle**: Self-hosted fallback
4. **Legacy Build**: ES5 compatible version
5. **Minimal Implementation**: Basic functionality
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Error state UI

#### Network Fallbacks

**Offline Support**:
- Cache API for offline availability
- IndexedDB for data persistence
- Local Storage for settings
- Offline-first architecture
- Sync when connection returns

**Slow Network Handling**:
- Reduced feature set for 2G
- Lazy image loading
- Deferred non-critical resources
- Progressive rendering
- Timeout management

#### Feature Fallbacks

**Missing Capabilities**:
- No-op implementations for optional features
- Progressive disclosure of available features
- Clear messaging about limitations
- Alternative interaction patterns
- Upgrade prompts when appropriate

### Error Recovery

#### Recovery Strategies
1. **Automatic Retry**: With exponential backoff
2. **Alternative Loading**: Try different sources
3. **Partial Functionality**: Load what's available
4. **User Intervention**: Manual retry options
5. **State Preservation**: Don't lose user data

#### User Communication
- Clear error messages
- Actionable recovery steps
- Progress indicators
- Estimated wait times
- Support contact options

### Implementation Considerations

## Network-Aware Loading

### Connection Detection

#### Network Quality Assessment
Continuously monitor and categorize network conditions:
- Bandwidth estimation
- Latency measurement
- Packet loss detection
- Connection stability
- Data saver preferences

#### Adaptive Strategies

**High-Speed Networks** (4G/WiFi):
- Preload upcoming features
- High-quality assets
- Aggressive prefetching
- Full feature set
- Background updates

**Medium-Speed Networks** (3G):
- Load on demand
- Standard quality assets
- Selective prefetching
- Core features first
- Deferred updates

**Low-Speed Networks** (2G):
- Minimal feature set
- Low-quality assets
- No prefetching
- Text-only fallbacks
- Critical updates only

### Offline Capabilities

#### Offline Detection
- Navigator.onLine API
- Network request failures
- Service Worker events
- Connection change events
- Periodic connectivity checks

#### Offline Functionality
- Cached component rendering
- Queued data submission
- Local validation only
